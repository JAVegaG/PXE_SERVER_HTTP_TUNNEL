# P2P (Peer-to-peer) NETWORK ~ BLOCKCHAIN

To simulate a p2p network, the "Node.js" programming environment, and its package management system are downloaded, which allow the execution of scripts developed in JavaScript and its object-oriented programming paradigm, which will be used to define both the methods necessary for the creation of the blockchain network and its validation, as well as the attributes of an individual block of the network. When executing the "thecoin.js" file, a simulation of the network can be viewed with its main characteristics, such as the hashes that are exchanged between the computers on the network.
